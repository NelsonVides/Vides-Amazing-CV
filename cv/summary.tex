    Iâ€™m a young and ambitious guy, trained mathematician, who is deeply passionate about computers. I believe that \textit{if you're not growing, you're dying}; as such, I strive every day to reach further. My mathematical mindset is my most interesting asset: finding correct solutions to any facing problem is perhaps my biggest hobby. I'm deeply rooted into patterns and abstractions, I regard the concept of refactoring as a figure of speech where repetition is abstracted away in a pattern that models the problem at hand; it's a purely mathematical habit that will keep a codebase crystal clear. I believe in the models that mathematics give to any given language and design, from how Type Theory can model data and programs, to how Categories can model a software architecture. It's yet another purely mathematical habit I devote a lot of my time, that I believe will keep programs correct, maintainable and safe.
