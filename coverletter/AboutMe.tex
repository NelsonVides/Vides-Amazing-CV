\lettersection{About Me}
Iâ€™m a young guy, ambitious, trained mathematician, who is very passionate about computers. With a quite academical taste most of the time, finding correct solutions to any facing problem is perhaps my biggest hobby. I believe that \textit{if you're not growing, you're dying}; as such, I strive every day to reach further, dreaming of the things I'm yet to learn and the problems I'm yet to solve. I take care of my time to the detail, always seeking to invest in myself and my beloved ones, in all fields of my life. Little things give me as much pleasure than a well done job, whether it's about a training in the gym, a bike trip, the last novel I read, the dinner I prepare for my girlfriend, the ongoing research I'm digging into, or the problems I find in my workplace.
