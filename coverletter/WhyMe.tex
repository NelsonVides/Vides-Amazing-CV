\lettersection{Why Me?}

Experience has shown me and my employers that I always find a solution for whatever problem I encounter. Long time ago, working on a non-IT job related to finances, I realised my entire project was investing so much time in reporting: without anybody asking me, I decided to learn VBA/VBS and C\#, and I developed scripts that would do the job; I reduced reporting times for a project of more than a hundred people below half of where they were. In a different job, IT related, I didn't like the way the team was interfacing to the remote ERP databases by mere GUI scripting: I developed C++ small apps to wrap around the native ERP binaries, bypassing the whole GUI, with finer control and deterministic behaviour.
